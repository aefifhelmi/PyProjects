Pong Game â€” Phase 0 refactor template


Files included in this template (copy each section into its own file):
- config.py
- asset_loader.py
- entities.py
- main.py


How to use
1. Create a project directory (e.g. `pong/`) and an `assets/` subdirectory.
2. Split the sections below into separate files with the filenames shown above.
3. Install pygame: `pip install pygame`.
4. Run the game: `python main.py`.
